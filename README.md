# ✨ Resham’s Personal Blog

Welcome to my digital corner on the internet — a place where I document what I learn, build, and explore. From code snippets to creative experiments, this blog is both a tech journal and a timeline of my growth as a developer.

## 📌 What's Inside

- 🧠 Learning logs from daily dev discoveries  
- 🛠️ Project breakdowns, design ideas, and architecture notes  
- ✍️ Personal thoughts, tech rants, and the occasional poem  
- 📚 Resources that helped me (and might help you too)

## 🚀 Tech Stack

This blog is built with:

- **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)** + **[React](https://react.dev/)** — for blazing-fast development and a modern frontend experience  
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** — to keep it stylish yet minimal  
- **[Sanity CMS](https://www.sanity.io/)** — for structured content and real-time editing  
- **[ShadCN/UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/)** — for a polished, accessible component base  

## 🌈 Design Philosophy

Clean. Minimal. Personal. This blog is made to feel like a cozy dev journal — not too flashy, but full of heart (and code).
